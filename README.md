# sedarplusplus
Sedar+ sucks. This chrome extension makes it suck a little less.

This is a simple chrome extension. 
To use it, click on <> Code -> Local -> Download ZIP. 
Unzip it into a folder. 
Go to Chrome / Edge, and go to extensions page, then turn on developer mode.
Click on load unpacked and select the folder. 

The extension itself is self explanatory. Enter the company name you want to search for and press enter / search button.
The widget will bring you to the company's document page, with documents ordered in reverse chronological order.
